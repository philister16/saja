# Saja
A super small CLI for Sassyjade
## Usage
```
$ saja <yourProject>
```
This command will fetch the latest version of Sassyjade boilerplate and install all its dependencies in a new folder called "your Project", relative to the folder from where you ran the command.
```
$ saja --blank <yourProject>
```
If you don't want the default folder and file structre of Sassyjade add the `--blank` flag. You can also just use `-b` instead.
